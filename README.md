# Oncall scheduling

This should be a set of tools that help to schedule an oncall but is at a
humble beginning. The first goal is to support:

* Schedule primary and secondar for oncall.
* Primary and secondary are different.
* Honor OOO.
* Honor public holidays (multi-location team).
* Primary not back to back.
* Rolling window of assignments (for incremental assignments)
